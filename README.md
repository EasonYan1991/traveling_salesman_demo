# Traveling Salesman Demo

### Built with JavaFX/TornadoFX and Kotlin

This is a Kotlin application (built with [TornadoFX](https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx) visuals) to demonstrate multiple algorithms to solve the [Traveling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem). 

I found this problem interesting due to its simple objective, and yet astronomically large permutations (60 cities = more tour combinations than there are atoms in the universe) that must be searched through. 

**Current Algorithms**

* RANDOM
* GREEDY
* OVERLAP ELIMINATION
* 2-OPT
* SIMULATED ANNEALING
